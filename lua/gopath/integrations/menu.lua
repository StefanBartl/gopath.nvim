---@module 'gopath.integrations.menu'
---@brief Context-aware "Paths" menu entry for a host's global right-click menu.
---@description
--- gopath.nvim does not depend on a menu plugin. It *provides* a list of
--- entries in the shape `ui.contextmenu` (ui.nvim, soft dependency) expects,
--- and a host -- typically the user's own RightMouse dispatcher -- composes
--- them into its own menu for the current buffer:
--- >
---   local items = require("gopath.integrations.menu").items()
---   -- prepend/append `items` to your own menu table, then menu.open(composed)
--- <
--- Same "Pattern-B" shape as `open.integrations.menu` (`items`/`submenu`, no
--- trigger, no hard renderer dependency) and `filetree.integrations.menu`.
---
--- Resolves whatever gopath would resolve right here:
---   - Still in Visual mode when this runs (a right-click while a selection
---     is up, before any <Esc>): the selected text, via
---     `gopath.resolve_selection` -- a `$VAR/rest` reference or a URL, which
---     is what lets a PARTIALLY selected one resolve here too, not just a
---     fully recognized path (tailsearch's filesystem suffix search is
---     deliberately NOT tried here: it is what `:GopathProbe` is for, and a
---     menu entry that silently kicks off a filesystem walk on every
---     right-click would be a bad trade for the common "nothing matched"
---     case).
---   - Otherwise: the normal cursor-based pipeline
---     (`gopath.resolve.resolve_at_cursor`) -- help/url/env/language
---     resolvers, a free-text path, a Markdown link, anything `gF` would
---     find. The "lsp" language provider is skipped (treesitter/builtin
---     stay) -- see `MENU_RESOLVE_OPTS` for why.
---
--- Self-gating: an empty list / nil submenu when ui.nvim is absent, or
--- nothing resolves under the cursor/selection -- so a host can safely
--- `vim.list_extend` `M.items()` unconditionally, or skip the fly-out
--- entirely when `M.submenu()` returns nil.

---Lazily load ui.contextmenu. This module is itself opt-in (never required
---by `gopath.setup()`); without ui.nvim there is nothing to build entries
---with, not a hard error.

---The live visual selection, as plain text -- `vim.fn.getpos("v")` (the
---selection's other end) to `vim.fn.getpos(".")` (the cursor), NOT the `'<`/
---`'>` marks: those persist long after Visual mode ends and cannot tell a
---live selection from a stale one (the exact ambiguity
---`gopath.commands.probe_selection` needs an explicit `opts.selection` flag
---to work around). Checking `vim.fn.mode()` fresh, right here, is what lets
---this module tell the difference on its own -- multi-line selections are
---deliberately not supported: a right-click menu is about "this one thing
---under/around the pointer", not a multi-line span.
---
---Charwise ("v") and blockwise ("\22", single line only -- multi-line is
---already excluded above) both use column bounds that mean what they say.
---Linewise ("V") does not: pressing `V` without moving the cursor further
---reports the SAME column for both `getpos("v")` and `getpos(".")` (the
---cursor's own), so slicing the line by column would grab one arbitrary
---character instead of the whole selected line -- excluded here for that
---reason, falling through to the cursor-based pipeline like the multi-line
---case.

---Cursor-pipeline options for a menu popup: same as the default except the
---language pipeline skips the "lsp" provider. `resolve_at_cursor` would
---otherwise try an LSP request (up to `lsp_timeout_ms`, 200ms by default)
---*synchronously* whenever nothing cheaper already matched -- i.e. most
---right-clicks on ordinary code, since help/url/env/filetoken/linepath all
---come up empty there. gopath's own docs/FEATURES/INTEGRATIONS.md documents
---this exact cost for hover.nvim's CursorHold trigger, worked around with a
---caller-side gate; a context menu is at least as latency-sensitive as a
---hover, and unlike CursorHold it fires on every click, not after idling.
---treesitter/builtin stay in the order -- only the network/IPC-bound
---provider is skipped.
---
---Only takes effect in the default "hybrid" mode: `gopath.resolve`'s own
---precedence forces `order = {"lsp"}` outright when the user has configured
---`mode = "lsp"`, ignoring any `opts.order` passed in -- a deliberate
---per-user choice this does not fight.
