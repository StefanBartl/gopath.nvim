---@module 'gopath.bindings.keymaps'
--- The keymap preset, declared as named actions.
---
--- Declared through `lib.nvim.bindings.keymap`'s registry rather than bound
--- here by hand. Every key stays an individually overridable config value and
--- `false` still drops just that one, but a wrong *name* is now reported
--- instead of silently binding nothing:
---
---   [lib.nvim.bindings.keymap] gopath: no such keymap action: open_hear
---   (did you mean open_here?)
---
--- `mappings = false` still switches the whole preset off, and every `lhs`
--- still accepts a list -- `open_here = { "gF", "<2-LeftMouse>" }` binds both.
