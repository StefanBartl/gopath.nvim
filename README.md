One key, and you are at the file the cursor is pointing at — however that
reference happens to be written. gopath.nvim resolves symbols, `require()`
paths and arbitrary file references under the cursor through a multi-phase
pipeline, so a `require("a.b")`, a bare path, a `:help` tag and a
stack-trace line all end in the same place: the right file, at the right line.

> **[buffer-ctx.nvim](https://github.com/StefanBartl/buffer-ctx.nvim)** — the
> other direction: it *writes* a `require("foo.bar")` or `path:line` reference,
> gopath jumps back to one.
>
> **[hover.nvim](https://github.com/StefanBartl/hover.nvim)** and
> **[images.nvim](https://github.com/StefanBartl/images.nvim)** — both call
> `resolve_at_cursor()` from outside, through `pcall`, so gopath stays a soft
> dependency on their side. What they rely on is
> [docs/FEATURES/INTEGRATIONS.md](docs/FEATURES/INTEGRATIONS.md).
>
> **[open.nvim](https://github.com/StefanBartl/open.nvim)** — takes over where
> the target is not a file at all: a URL, a directory, an application.
>
> All of the above are soft: without them everything else works unchanged.
> [lib.nvim](https://github.com/StefanBartl/lib.nvim) is the one real
> dependency — see [Requirements](docs/installation.md#requirements).
